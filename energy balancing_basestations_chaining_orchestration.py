# AI model can be used to optimize the energy consumption of radio base stations by chaining together different machine learning algorithms. 
# The first algorithm can be used to forecast traffic demand for each base station. The
# second algorithm can then use this forecast to determine the optimal power settings for each base station.
# Finally, a third algorithm can be used to monitor the energy consumption of the base stations and make adjustments to
# the power settings as needed.
